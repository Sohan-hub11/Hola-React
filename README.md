# Hola-React
Hola-React is designed to provide a clean, lightweight, and scalable starting point for React-based applications. Whether you are building a simple UI project or a more complex SPA (Single Page Application), It aims to give you a structured foundation so you can focus on your features rather than setup to quickly jump-start front-end development with React.

---

## ✅ Features  
- Built with React (and optionally TypeScript if configured)  
- Clean, responsive UI scaffold  
- Modular folder structure ready for components, pages, and shared utilities  
- Easy to extend: you can integrate routing, state management (e.g., Context or Redux), API services, etc.  
- Development-friendly: supports fast refresh, live dev server, building for production.

## 🚀 Getting Started  
### Prerequisites  
- Node.js (v14 or later recommended)  
- npm or Yarn as package manager  

---

### Installation  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sohan-hub11/Hola-React.git
   cd Hola-React

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install

3. Configure environment variables if needed (e.g., .env file for API endpoints, auth keys).
  - Running the App

    For development:
    ```bash
    npm start
    # or
    yarn start

   This should launch the app locally (typically at http://localhost:3000/ or as configured).

  For production build:
  
  ```bash
    npm run build
    # or
    yarn build
```
This will generate optimized static files in build/ (or the equivalent output folder) ready for deployment.
