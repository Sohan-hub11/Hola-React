# Hola-React
Hola-React is designed to provide a clean, lightweight, and scalable starting point for React-based applications. Whether you are building a simple UI project or a more complex SPA (Single Page Application), Hola-React aims to give you a structured foundation so you can focus on your features rather than setup to quickly jump-start front-end development with React.
